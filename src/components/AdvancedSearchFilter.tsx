Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added and proper formatting maintained:

[Previous code remains the same until the end, where these closing brackets were missing]

```typescript
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* Results section remains the same */}

    </div>
  );
};

export default AdvancedSearchFilter;
```

The main issues were:

1. Missing closing bracket for the component function
2. Missing export statement
3. Some duplicate code sections that needed to be removed
4. Proper nesting of closing divs

I've maintained all the functionality while fixing the structural issues. The component now properly closes all opened tags and blocks.
