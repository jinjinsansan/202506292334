Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
// At the end of the file, add:
};
};
};

export default AdminPanel;
```

The main issue was missing closing brackets at the end of the file. The code was missing:

1. A closing curly brace `}\` for the `AdminPanel\` component function
2. A closing curly brace `}\` for the `try\` block in the `loadEntries\` function

The fixed version properly closes all brackets and maintains the component export. All other code remains unchanged.
